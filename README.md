# Samsung Wallet For Rooted Samsung Device 
On a rooted samsung device, there is no way to use samsung Pass and wallet
but Samsung wallet(mini) can work as it does not depend on knox,so i made 
a magisk module that spoof your device to m32, which officially supports
samsung pay mini.
# How to Get Wallet on Rooted Device
just [download](https://github.com/TheBizarreAbhishek/Samsung-Wallet-Fix/releases/download/v1.0.0/Samsung.Wallet.Fix.zip) and flash module 
After that, [download](https://github.com/TheBizarreAbhishek/Samsung-Wallet-Fix/releases/download/v1.0.0/Samsung.Wallet_v5.5.43.554300232.apk) the spay mini app and set it up 
after full setup, you can remove the samsung wallet fix module 
# How to Update Wallet App
just turn on an update on the wallet app wherever there will be a new update. Wallet will notify you, and you can visit this repo to download the latest wallet apk from the release 
# Notice

if you want to download it on your own, you can 
I have extracted the wallet app from m32 firmware.
